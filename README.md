# HMM-Forward-Viterbi

A simple implementation of the Forward and Viterbi Algorithms for Hidden Markov Models.

* Test sentence analyzed using HMM part of speech (POS) tagger
  * Determine probability of observing test sentence given HMM
  * Determine most likely POS sequence given observed states
  
This HMM is based on frequency counts from the Brown corpus.
